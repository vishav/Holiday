    of many Muslim holidays inasmuch as these are determined annually by proclamations
    from local religious authorities. Calculated dates for many Hindu and Buddhist
    holidays are also approximate. In such cases, our calculations are usually correct
    within a day. In all cases it is advisable to cross check our results with the
    relevant official agencies.</p>
